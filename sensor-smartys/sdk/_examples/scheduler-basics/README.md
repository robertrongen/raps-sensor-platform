#  Scheduler basic example

This example explains how the sheduler plans the tasks.
The application_task() Task is created automatically by SDK.
If you need more tasks then call the bc_scheduler_register()

This example demonstrates scheduling the task to blink a LED. The right and more
efficient way would be use just the bc_led_set_mode(&led, BC_LED_MODE_BLINK) function
to set the blinking speed and the toggling will be handled in the background.
